## Design Principles

The script is designed to download the latest binary release from GitHub using repository name (e.g., `jqlang/jq`). The script is coded for `cmd.exe`, has been developed and tested on Windows 10 LTSC 2021. The script relies on stock tools only. It uses `curl` for downloading and `tar` for extracting zip archives. The script also has an optional soft dependency on `jq` for analyzing GitHub JSON release metadata. The script will use installed `jq`, if available. Otherwise, it will download `jq` from GitHub. In case of failure, the script falls back to using the Windows `findstr` tool for RegEx-based analysis.

The script aims to handle two types of repos. Some repos use robust release naming convention where version number is not included in the file name (URL suffix), but each target platform has a version independent platform-specific name. The latest release for such repos (assuming they follow established modern conventions) can be downloaded directly without any metadata analysis using a template `https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/releases/latest/download/<release_name>`.

If the repo's naming convention includes version number in the filename (in addition to platform suffix), JSON file containing release metadata needs to be obtained first via `https://api.github.com/repos/<user>/<repo>/releases/latest`. Assuming, the naming convention is still sufficiently robust, actual asset URL can the be extract from the `browser_download_url` using platform-specific suffix for matching.

The main script is structured as a modular code file following a pseudo-procedural organization. The first block of the script (`:HELP`) is the module's "docstring" that also serves as a help message printed to console, if requested via conventional command line argument (at presently, the help option is the only processed command line argument).

The second code block `:MAIN`, as the name suggests, orchestrates high-level workflows by calling subroutines implementing specific functionality. The subroutine blocks are placed after the main block, aiming to follow the single well-defined responsibility per routine design principle. The core routines include `:RETRIEVE_ASSET_URL` responsible for downloading release metadata and extracting specific asset URL. This routine is called by the primary download entry, `:ASSET_DOWNLOAD`, if necessary.

Two other small routines are responsible for setting cache directory (`:CACHE_DIR`) and console color scheme (`:ESCAPE_COLORS`).

The script is designed to be verbose for troubleshooting potential issues, and ANSI escape sequences are used to structure output with color code. To limit mixing escape sequences with batch code and allow for increased flexibility, `:ESCAPE_COLORS` sets environment variables, which are then used throughout the code. This approach also avoids another potential subtle pitfall - having the special `ESC`  character dispersed throughout the file. Because of its special nature, the `ESC` character may cause issues under specific condition, including complete loss. The script uses this character only twice within the dedicated `:ESCAPE_COLORS` routine, mitigating potential issues.

The code strives to perform careful explicit error checking for all critical operations, including file system and network operations, as well as utility use. The primary goal, as usual, is to identify a critical error as soon as possible and fail early with a clear and meaningful error message rather then letting the script proceed with normal logic after failed operations.

The script does not
