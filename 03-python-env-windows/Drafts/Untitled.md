Managing Python on Windows can feel like walking through quicksand. Between global installs, conflicting `PATH` entries, and "smart" shell hooks that modify your registry, things get messy - fast.

This post documents a cleaner alternative. The workflow uses a simple batch script to create Conda-based environments that are lightweight, deterministic, and fully transparent. It avoids shell initialization, activation hooks, and registry pollution entirely.

The key insight? **Don't let Micromamba handle activation or initialization.** Just let it do the one thing it excels at: creating environments.

The result is a simple `cmd.exe` workflow that is:
-   âœ… **Explicit:** Every step is clear and inspectable.
-   âœ… **Isolated:** No registry edits or global state changes.
-   âœ… **Reproducible:** Build and tear down identical environments every time.
-   âœ… **Simple:** No dependency on PowerShell or complex tooling.

### The Core Idea ðŸ’¡

> Use `micromamba.exe` **once** to bootstrap a self-contained environment. For all other tasks - installing packages, activation, etc. - use the standard `conda` or `mamba` commands that now live *inside* that new environment. No shell hooks, no registry edits, no magic.

---

## The Problem with "Smart" Setups

Typical Python setups on Windows rely on a system-wide interpreter and shell-level magic, which introduces several points of failure:
-   Activation depends on inherited `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` variables.
-   One wrong entry in your `PATH` and scripts can silently use the wrong Python interpreter.
-   Shell hooks (`shell init`) can persist unwanted settings across sessions by modifying the registry.
-   Uninstalling often leaves clutter behind.

Our approach flips the model by enforcing a stricter, cleaner separation:
-   **No global Python installation.**
-   Each shell session is linked to **exactly one** environment at a time.
-   **No persistent shell hooks** or `AutoRun` modifications.

Each environment becomes a sealed unit you can create, activate, and destroy with zero side effects.

## The Right Tool for the Job

**Micromamba** is a fantastic tool for this workflow. It's a tiny, standalone binary perfect for creating Conda environments without needing an existing Python installation.

However, its shell integration features can be problematic on Windows:
-   The official `install.bat` script is broken.
-   `micromamba shell init` modifies registry `AutoRun` entries, affecting every `cmd.exe` session.
-   It can generate scripts with hard-coded absolute paths, making environments less portable.

We sidestep these issues entirely. Instead of fighting Micromamba's shell management, **we don't use it at all**. The bootstrap script calls `micromamba.exe` only once to build the environment. After that, we rely on the robust tools (Mamba and Conda) it installs *inside* the environment.

## The Bootstrap Workflow

### Step 1: Bootstrap the Environment

Run the bootstrap script from your terminal to create a new, self-contained environment.

```batch
Micromamba_bootstrap.bat my_env 3.12
````

This single command performs several actions:

1. Downloads the `micromamba.exe` binary if it's missing.
    
2. Creates a new, self-contained environment with Python, Mamba, and Conda via the `create` command.
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```
    micromamba.exe create -p "%ENV_PREFIX%" python=3.12 mamba conda
    ```
    
3. Activates the new environment once to verify its integrity.
    

Your new environment is now ready at a path like `DRIVE:\path\to\envs\my_env_3_12`, complete with `python.exe`, `mamba.exe`, and `conda.exe`.

### Step 2: Use the Environment

With the environment created, you manage it using the standard Mamba or Conda commands from within its `condabin` directory.

Code snippet

```
call "%ENV_PREFIX%\condabin\mamba.bat" activate
mamba install numpy scipy
```

No special Micromamba commands, no hidden hooks. Just a clean environment that works as expected.

## Final Words

This approach provides a controlled and reproducible method for bootstrapping Python environments on Windows. By keeping the logic explicit and avoiding shell-level modifications, you get a robust setup that is easy to manage, version, and share.
