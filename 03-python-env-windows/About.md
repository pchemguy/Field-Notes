This repository documents an experimental workflow for initializing and managing isolated Python environments on Windows using Micromamba as a lightweight, dependency-free bootstrapper. It consolidates findings, implementation notes, and practical scripts developed to establish a fully self-contained, reproducible environment model without system-wide dependencies or shell-level initialization.
