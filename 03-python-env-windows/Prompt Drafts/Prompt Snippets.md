Bootstrapping Python envs on Windows
- Do not use a system-wide Python installation (root environment)
- Instead, each environment should be standalone, with at most one environment ever present in any given shell ancestry line (Path and other key environment variables)
- Each environment is bootstrapped using a standalone simple tool with no Python dependencies.
- Primary responsibility of the bootstrapping tool - creation of a basic environment in an empty directory, including a particular version of Python plus one of the standard mature package managers, integrated within the Python environment (a Python-package-based).
- Once minimalistic environment is created, it should be possible to activate it in any shell using a standard script.
- After environment is activated, it is managed by the installed package managers, the bootstrapping tool should no longer be used.
- For the Conda-based ecosystem, Micromamba is an example of such a bootstrapping tool meeting specified requirements: it should be used to install Python/Conda/Mamba


## Initial

Help me revise this draft. Present text is a collection of narrated notes documenting exploration/discovery of the described topic, including important technical details, such as code snippets and discussions. I need to transform this text into a cohesive structured long technical note for myself, so that all technical insights are readily available in case I switch of to a different topic and later would want to go back. I should not need to search for specific included details or rediscover them, everything should be retained. The structure and style should be revised and reorganized to be more like a hybrid of a guide with a detailed technical reference information integrated in a single cohesive structured document.

- Keep Markdown - the text will be hosted on a personal GitHub repo for technical notes.
- Rewrite and restructure everything into a polished, clearly sectioned document (keeping all technical content but removing narrative “discovery” style) with clear sections like Overview, Design Principles, Micromamba Bootstrapping Workflow, Known Issues & Fixes, Practical Scripts, etc.
- Add **cross-references, command summaries, and side notes/tips** (as in a technical manual).
- Attached are the actual developed scripts, providing full and flexible automation of the discussed objective. These scripts will be included as `.bat` files and placed in the same directory as the note itself. A walkthrough might be either integrated in the appropriate parts of the text or be framed as a separate section (not sure which one will work better here)


### **Proposed Structure**

1. **Overview**    
    - Context, rationale, and goals of this environment setup approach.
    - Comparison to conventional Conda/Mamba workflows.
2. **Design Principles**
    - Philosophy: no global/system Python; fully isolated environments.
    - Safety, reproducibility, and “fail loudly” rationale.
3. **Micromamba Fundamentals**
    - Overview of Micromamba as a bootstrap tool.
    - Windows-specific considerations (CMD vs PowerShell).
    - Directory conventions and environment layout.
4. **Bootstrapping Workflow**
    - Step-by-step breakdown of how Micromamba is installed and initialized.
    - Script `Micromamba_bootstrap.bat`:
        - Key automation logic, variable resolution, directory creation.
        - Download of `micromamba.exe`, initialization steps, environment setup.
        - Integration points for future package installs.
    - Supporting utility `get_sed.bat`:
        - Purpose and how it’s used to ensure portability.
5. **Activation and Environment Management**
    - Differences between `.exe` and `.bat` calls.
    - Required variables (`MAMBA_EXE`, `MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX`, etc.).
    - Correct sequence of initialization and activation.
    - Portable vs. initialized (registry-linked) modes.
6. **Known Issues and Workarounds**
    - Broken `install.bat` upstream.
    - Incorrect or incomplete `--shell` usage examples.
    - AutoRun registry risk.
    - Path resolution order pitfalls.
    - Absolute vs. relative path bugs in generated scripts.
7. **Command Reference and Examples**
    - Verified working commands with correct syntax.
    - Inline documentation on behavior differences.
8. **Practical Automation Scripts**
    - Sample sections from both `.bat` files (with explanations).
    - References to full versions in repo.
9. **Appendix**
    - Registry tweaks (LongPathsEnabled).
    - Relevant file locations and variable names.
    - References and documentation links.


### **Script Design Notes**

- **Purpose and role** in the overall workflow.
- **Detailed breakdown** of logic and control flow (variables, decisions, calls).
- **Key technical mechanisms** (downloads, environment variable setup, error handling).
- **Interdependencies** between the two scripts.
- **Design notes** (robustness, portability, and possible improvements).


What I need is essentially a **structured, reference-grade rewrite** of my working notes:
- preserving all insights, tests, and discovered behaviors
- but reorganized into a clear, navigable document that reads like a **deep technical guide + field notes hybrid**

Present text is a collection of narrated notes documenting exploration/discovery of the described topic, including important technical details, such as code smippets and discussions. I need to transform this text into a cohesive structured long technical note for myself, so that all technical insights are readily avaialble in case I switch of to a different topic and later would want to go back. I should not need to search for specific included details or rediscover them, everything should be retained. The structure and style should be revised and reorganized to be more like a hybrid of a guide with a detailed technical reference information integrated in a single cohesive structured document.

## **Goal**

Transform your draft into a **long-form, structured technical note** that you can:
- revisit months later and immediately recover all key insights,
- extract specific implementation details (commands, error causes, script logic),
- and understand _why_ each design decision was made.

## **Bootstrapping and Managing Python Environments on Windows using Micromamba and Mamba**

### **1. Overview and Motivation**

- Briefly explain Python environment management and why a clean bootstrap is needed.
- Contrast with the fragile “system + virtualenv” model.
- Explain your philosophy: no system Python, no global paths, only standalone self-contained environments.

### **2. Environment Isolation Model**

- Describe your “no master Python” model:    
    - Clean shells, single environment in PATH.        
    - Advantages (no contamination, failure is explicit).
    - Contrast with fallback behavior of system+virtualenv setups.

### **3. Bootstrapping Strategy**

- State the requirements:    
    - Python-less bootstrap tool.
    - Capable of creating minimal Conda-based environments.
    - Portable and automatable on Windows (cmd.exe).
- Introduce **Micromamba** as the best candidate and define its role:
    - Only used for **initial environment creation**.
    - Delegation of lifecycle management to **Mamba/Conda**.

### **4. Known Issues with Micromamba on Windows**

- List and explain in detail:    
    1. Broken `install.bat` (syntactic errors, nonfunctional).
    2. Poor or inconsistent documentation.
    3. Misleading help messages.
    4. Dangerous behavior of `micromamba shell init` (registry `AutoRun`).
    5. Hardcoded absolute paths in generated scripts.

### **5. Safe Usage Principles**

- State your workaround policy:    
    - Never call `micromamba shell init` directly.
    - Avoid registry modifications.
    - Use only portable `micromamba shell hook` and manual configuration.
    - Manage PATH explicitly.

### **6. Correct Command Templates**

- Show corrected, properly formatted commands and explain each parameter:    
    - `micromamba shell hook --shell cmd.exe --root-prefix={PREFIX}`
    - `micromamba shell activate --shell cmd.exe -p {PREFIX}`
- Include code blocks and sample outputs.

### **7. Analysis of Generated Scripts**

- Compare contents and purpose of:    
    - `mamba_hook.bat`
    - `micromamba.bat`
    - `condabin` vs `Scripts` placement
- Explain how PATH precedence affects `.bat` vs `.exe` resolution.
- Note discovered variable dependencies (`MAMBA_EXE`, `MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX`).

### **8. Practical Workarounds**

- Summarize your verified working procedure:    
    1. Download `micromamba.exe` manually via `curl`.
    2. Place it in `{PREFIX}\Scripts`.
    3. Define essential variables manually.
    4. Use `.bat` wrappers only when activating.
    5. After environment creation, use `mamba` or `conda` for everything else.
- Include final code snippet showing a working bootstrap batch.

### **9. Observations and Recommendations**

- Describe discovered behaviors:    
    - PATH reorderings during activation.
    - Hardcoded paths.
    - Shell initialization quirks.
- Summarize what works reliably and what to avoid.

### **10. Conclusion**

- Restate key philosophy:    
    - Micromamba is an excellent bootstrapper but an unreliable manager.
    - Use it only for environment creation.
    - Once created, manage via Mamba or Conda for full stability.
