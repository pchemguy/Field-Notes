I am trying to learn how I can use Gemini Code Assist in my projects. I have Gemini Pro subscription, but I have not used Gemini CLI tools yet. For now, I need to understand what I can do within features provided by Gemini Pro subscription. I do not to pay for a separate Gemini Code Assist subscription or any API. My projects are hosted on GitHub, and I set VSCode with Gemini Code Assist extension. I would prefer staying away from the CLI tools for now, but I am willing to consider using them. Regardless, I need a clear and detailed guide for various tasks that can be performed with and without CLI tools, specific setup instructions for Windows 10 machine (WSL is not available and will not be available, but I do have MSYS2 environment set up with Ruby installer, which can potentially be used, if provides compelling benefits). I am specifically interested in developing Python projects. I do not have any system Python intentionally. I use Conda environments and specific environment needed for a particular project is activated within a shell via a .bat script.

Within constrains specified above, I am specifically interested in detailed guidelines for these advertised features:
- Use context and built-in tools to improve generated content.
- Get solutions to complex tasks with multiple steps.
- Generate code from design documents, issues, and `TODO` comments.
- Control the agent behavior by commenting on, editing, and approving plans and tool use during execution.
I am interested in ways how I can setup and execute agentic coding tasks and use GitHub tools/features for this purpose.

Separately, I have virtually no understanding of MCP servers and I need to figure out how relevant this thing might be for me given constrains above.
