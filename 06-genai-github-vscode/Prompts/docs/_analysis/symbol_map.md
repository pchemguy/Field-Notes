# **Symbol Map — TrakEM2 Codebase**

*Java Packages, Classes, Responsibilities, and Subsystem Candidates*
*(Generated and maintained by AI agents and human collaborators)*

This document records a structured representation of the TrakEM2 codebase. It is used for architecture reconstruction, component analysis, and downstream Python translation.

This is a *living document*. The VSCode AI agent will fill in content iteratively across Phase 1 and Phase 2.

# **0. Global Summary (To Be Filled After Initial Pass)**

* Total packages discovered:
* Total classes discovered:
* Initial subsystem candidates:
* Notes and uncertainties:

---

# **1. Packages Overview**

(List each package and a short description once the agent extracts them.)

## **Package: `<package.name>`**

**Description:**
**Primary Responsibilities:**
-----------------------------

*

**Notable Classes:**

* `<ClassA>` – brief responsibility
* `<ClassB>` – brief responsibility
*

**Subsystem Candidate:**
(e.g., Rendering / Data Model / IO / UI / Operations)

---

(Repeat package blocks as needed; one per package.)

---

# **2. Class Index by Package**

For each package, enumerate all classes with short responsibility notes.

### **Package `<package.name>`**

| Class         | Role / Responsibility | Notes |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ----- |
| `<ClassName>` |                       |       |
| `<ClassName>` |                       |       |
| `<ClassName>` |                       |       |

# **3. Interface & Enum Index**

### Interfaces

| Interface | Purpose | Notes |
| --------- | ------- | ----- |
|           |         |       |

### Enums

| Enum | Purpose | Notes |
