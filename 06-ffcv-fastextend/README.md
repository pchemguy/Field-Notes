# Installation of FFCV and Fastxtend on Windows

The [Fast Forward Computer Vision (FFCV) library](https://github.com/libffcv/ffcv) aims to address the data loading bottleneck occurring, for example, when training AI models using a large dataset not fitting within RAM and consisting of large number of small files, such as [ImageNet-1K, ILSVRC2012](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/). A related project, [Fastxtend](https://github.com/warner-benjamin/fastxtend/), aims to bridge FFCV with [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai). Both FFCV and fastxtend have not been unfortunately updated since 2023, but I wanted to give them a try anyway.
