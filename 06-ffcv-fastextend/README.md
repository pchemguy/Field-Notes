# Building and Installation of FFCV on Windows

The [Fast Forward Computer Vision (FFCV) library](https://github.com/libffcv/ffcv) aims to address the data loading bottleneck occurring, for example, when training AI models using a large dataset not fitting within RAM and consisting of large number of small files, such as [ImageNet-1K, ILSVRC2012](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/). A related project, [Fastxtend](https://github.com/warner-benjamin/fastxtend/), aims to bridge FFCV with [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai). Both FFCV and fastxtend have not been unfortunately updated since 2023, but I wanted to give them a try anyway. I primarily use Windows and both projects claimed Windows support. However, FFCV proved to be quite tricky to get installed.

FFCV's GitHub repository README provides very concise installation instructions, and the initial attempts has unsurprisingly failed. Very first attempts resulted in an error with the trace referring to missing OpenCV package or something. That was the only issue covered by the provided installation instructions.

The next troubleshooting round was due to a confusing message regarding missing Microsoft Visual C++. It was confusing for a couple reasons. On the one hand, I had not anticipated that this package would require compilation (in fact, besides GitHub, FFCV is primarily distributed as a PyPI package, and its [download section](https://pypi.org/project/ffcv/#files) clearly shows that only source code distribution is available). And a major issue, however, was in fact that I installed MS Build Tools, a native Windows toolchain, which I used before (though I used a separate installation) for direct building (not involving Python). I have previously discussed a Micromamba-based [approach](https://github.com/pchemguy/Field-Notes/blob/main/03-python-env-windows/README.md) to bootstrapping clean Python environments, which does not have a Python dependency. Being able to reproducibly and efficiently bootstrap clean Python environments without the need to use base/system/root Python installation is particularly important for troubleshooting environment configuration problems. I have also covered the causes of Python (actually `pip`/`setuptools`) not seeing activated MSBuild environment in an [SO QA](https://stackoverflow.com/q/79789580) and a [separate post](https://github.com/pchemguy/Field-Notes/blob/main/05-python-pip-msvc/README.md), so I will not cover these issues here.

The third round of troubleshooting yielded an error, which, I recognized, was coming from linker and was characteristic of missing build dependencies - the linker was unable to locate the necessary libraries to resolve certain calls.
