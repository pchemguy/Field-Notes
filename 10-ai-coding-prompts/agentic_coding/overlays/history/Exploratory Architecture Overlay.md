## TASK OVERLAY: Exploratory Architecture

This task is an early-stage architectural exploration.

Focus on:

* identifying decision axes and tradeoffs
* surfacing hidden constraints and unknowns
* expanding the design space before convergence

Explicitly:

* enumerate alternative approaches where materially different
* highlight long-term implications and irreversible choices
* call out assumptions that could invalidate an approach later

Do not:

* commit to a single solution prematurely
* produce detailed implementation code
* optimize for performance or micro-level concerns unless they affect architecture

Output structure (suggested, not mandatory):

* Problem restatement
* Known constraints
* Unknowns / risks
* Architecture options (with tradeoffs)
* Recommendations and open questions
