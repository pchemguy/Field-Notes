# Early (Pre-coding) Problem Analysis

This directory contains a set of experimental prompts for early (pre-coding) problem analysis:

- [0 Sample Objective Description](0%20Sample%20Objective%20Description.md) - sample problem description
- [1 OBSERVED_PROBLEM](1%20OBSERVED_PROBLEM.md) - the first prompt, where the target problem should go (in `## 1. User-Provided Observation (Ground Truth - VERBATIM)`)

`1 OBSERVED_PROBLEM` is submitted to a new LLM session with the problem added before submission. Then the rest of the prompts are submitted in order. In principle, all six prompts can be integrated into a single context setting prompt. Preliminary results are mixed. These prompts can, in principle, be used as is, but further development for now is postponed due to time constrains and different priorities on later (coding) stages.
