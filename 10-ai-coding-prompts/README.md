# Greenfield Development - from Concept / Idea to MVP

This note documents an ongoing exploration of applying hybrid AI-assisted techniques to greenfield development of coding projects. The focus is on transformation of observed problem or need - potential target for automation - into an MVP solution.

At high level, development process can be split into two major phases:

- pre-coding problem analysis, involving
    - understanding the problem, constraints, workflows;
    - decomposing the problem into elementary steps;
    - assessing importance of each elementary step for success of the full workflow/pipeline;
    - for each elementary step, assessing 
    - identifying key steps, where automation may potentially be most impactful;
    - preliminary assessments whether automation 
    - identifying potential automation targets;
    - considering potential system architectures
