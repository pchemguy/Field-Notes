# Field-Notes

> Practical notes and solutions from the tech trenches.

## About

This repository is my personal collection of technical notes, scripts, and solutions to the real-world problems I encounter as a tech professional. Think of it as a hybrid digital journal and personal knowledge base. Here, I document solutions for those often small but annoying IT issues that have tricky, non-obvious answers, as well as my exploration of various technical topics that spark my curiosity.

This repo serves two main purposes:
- A quick reference for my future self so I do not have to solve the same problem twice.
- A public resource in the hope that these notes might help someone else facing a similar challenge.

Each topic is contained within its own folder. Inside each folder, you will find a `README.md` file that details the problem and the step-by-step solution, along with any necessary scripts or configuration files. This repository is a living document, and its structure will evolve as I add more notes. Please consider everything a work-in-progress.

The solutions and documentation in this repository were developed with active assistance from Google's Gemini Pro for brainstorming, code generation, and the refinement of code and text. GitHub Copilot was also used, particularly for drafting commit messages. All solutions have been tested and validated by the author.
