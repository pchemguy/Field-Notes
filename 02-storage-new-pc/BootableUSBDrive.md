# Storage Considerations for a New PC, Part 2: Building a Dual-Purpose, Bootable USB Drive

## Summary

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for creating the essential tool for any power user: a versatile, multi-boot external SSD. We move beyond simple installers to build a dual-purpose "digital Swiss Army knife" that can boot a wide array of recovery tools while also serving as a portable drive for backups and applications.

The core of this project is Ventoy, a powerful tool that allows you to boot directly from `.ISO` and `.VHDX` files by simply dragging and dropping them. The guide focuses on using Rufus and YUMI exFAT tools in combination with standard Windows disk management tools for creating a custom partition layout for a dual-purpose drive and adding a Windows To Go environment. By the end, you will have a single, indispensable tool for system installation, maintenance, and recovery.

## 1. Introduction

In [Part 1](https://github.com/pchemguy/Field-Notes/blob/main/02-storage-new-pc/README.md) of this two-part series, we designed a resilient internal storage scheme for a new Windows workstation, a process that begins with a clean drive. Implementing that strategy requires an external, bootable medium to partition the system drive and perform a clean installation of the operating system. This guide covers the process of creating that essential tool: a versatile, multi-boot USB drive. The primary requirements are to support a full Windows To Go environment and standard Windows installation media, with the flexibility to boot other tools like system recovery suites and live Linux distributions.

A fast external Solid State Drive (SSD) is the ideal hardware for this task due to its speed and reliability. Since small-capacity SSDs are often poor value, a larger drive is more practical. This leads to our second core requirement: the drive must serve a dual purpose. It needs to function as our powerful multi-boot tool while the remaining space serves as a general-purpose drive for backups or portable applications. The goal is to achieve both of these functions on a single device without compromise.

## 2. Defining Boot Targets

Before building our drive, we must define its purpose. The goal is to create a "digital Swiss Army knife" by consolidating a curated set of installation, recovery, and utility environments onto a single, portable medium. The chosen tools will form our bootable library. Here is the list of essential boot targets for this project:

| Name                    | Source                                            | Image Size (GB) |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------: |
| Windows 10 ToGo         | Bootable VHD(X), see "Windows ToGo" section       |            10.0 |
| Windows 10 Install      | Official Installation ISO                         |             5.0 |
| Ubuntu 24.04 LTS        | Official Installation ISO                         |             5.9 |
| SystemRescue            | https://system-rescue.org                         |             1.1 |
| Lazesoft Recovery Suite | https://lazesoft.com/lazesoft-recovery-suite.html |             0.3 |
| Hirenâ€™s BootCD PE       | https://hirensbootcd.org                          |             3.1 |
| Sergei Strelec WinPE    | https://sergeistrelec.name                        |             3.2 |

This versatile collection requires approximately 30 GB of dedicated space. Now that we know _what_ we need to boot, the next step is to choose the right tool to build our multi-boot drive.

## 3. Choosing the Right Tool: A Comparison of Select Drive Creators

Several established utilities can create bootable USB drives, but they fall into two main categories: single-boot and multi-boot. While a single-boot tool like Rufus is fast and reliable for creating one-off installers, our goal of consolidating multiple tools requires a multi-boot solution.

| Name            | Multi-bootable | Key Feature                                                                                               | Source                         |
| --------------- | :------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Rufus           |       No       | The industry standard for fast, single-ISO flashing.                                                      | https://rufus.ie               |
| Ventoy          |      Yes       | Drag-and-drop ISOs directly onto the drive.                                                               | https://ventoy.net             |
| YUMI exFAT      |      Yes       | A GUI-based manager built on Ventoy.                                                                      | https://yumiusb.com/yumi-exfat |
| Easy2Boot (E2B) |      Yes       | A highly customizable and powerful boot manager for advanced use cases (grub4dos, grub2, Ventoy for E2B). | https://easy2boot.xyz          |

For the optimal balance of flexibility and ease of use, Ventoy is the clear winner. Its ability to boot directly from .ISO and .VHDX files - which you simply drag and drop onto the drive's main partition - makes managing and updating your toolkit incredibly simple.

YUMI exFAT is a user-friendly alternative that uses Ventoy as its underlying technology, offering a more guided, graphical interface for managing distributions. While tools like Easy2Boot provide even more advanced features, this power comes with a more complex workflow and is unnecessary for the goals outlined in this guide.

## 4. The Blueprint: A Ventoy-Based Multi-Boot Drive

The remainder of this guide will focus on creating a dual-purpose (bootable and archival) external SSD using the Ventoy method. This approach allows us to create a dedicated partition for bootable images while reserving the rest of the drive for other uses, such as portable applications or file archives. This clear separation ensures that the drive's functions will not interfere with each other.

### Understanding the Ventoy Partition Scheme

Ventoy works by creating two specific partitions at the beginning of the drive:
1. **The Main Data Partition:** A large, standard partition visible to your OS where you simply copy your `.ISO`, `.VHD`, and other image files.
2. **The EFI System Partition (`VTOYEFI`):** A small (32 MB), hidden partition containing the bootloader files. It is created automatically and should not be modified.   

Crucially, modern versions of Ventoy allow these two partitions to exist without occupying the entire drive, leaving the remaining space free for you to create your own additional partitions (see the official documentation for [MBR](https://ventoy.net/en/doc_disk_layout.html#reserve_space) and [GPT](https://ventoy.net/en/doc_disk_layout_gpt.html#reserve_space) layouts). We will leverage this feature for creation of our custom, multi-purpose drive.

### Step-by-Step Drive Preparation

While tools like YUMI exFAT can prepare a drive, they offer limited options. A more flexible approach is to partition the drive manually first and then perform a ["Non-destructive Install"](https://ventoy.net/en/doc_non_destructive.html) of Ventoy, providing full control over the disk layout.

If you want the benefit of a custom partition map _and_ the ability to use the YUMI exFAT management GUI, the process is as follows:
1. **Initial Prep:** Use the YUMI exFAT tool to format the target drive once. This process creates the necessary configuration directories.
2. **Save Config:** Copy the `YUMI` and `ventoy` directories from the drive's main partition to a temporary location on your computer.
3. **Manual Partitioning:** Use a tool like Windows Disk Management (WDM) or `diskpart` to wipe the drive and create your desired custom partition layout (see the example table below).
4. **Install Ventoy:** Run the `Ventoy2Disk.exe` tool and use the "Non-destructive Install" option on your newly partitioned drive. Ventoy will create the small `VTOYEFI` system partition without erasing your custom layout.
5. **Restore Config:** Label the first partition "YUMI" and copy the two directories you saved in Step 2 back onto it.
6. **Manage ISOs:** You can now use the YUMI exFAT GUI or simply drag and drop ISO files onto the "YUMI" partition.

> [!WARNING]
> 
> **Important Ventoy2Disk Notes:**
>  
> - To see internal or non-USB drives, you must select **Options -> Show All Devices**.
> - The **Options -> Non-destructive Install** menu item is an action that **immediately begins the installation**, not a setting you can toggle. Ensure you have the correct device selected _before_ clicking it.

### Example Layout and Advanced Management

The real power of this method is the ability to create a completely custom layout. Here is a sample blueprint for a multi-purpose SSD:

| Partition         | Anticipated Usage (GB) | Planned Allocation (GB) | Unallocated Space (GB) |
| ----------------- | ---------------------: | ----------------------: | ---------------------: |
| YUMI              |                     30 |                      40 |                      - |
| VTOYEFI (hidden)  |                      - |                       - |                     80 |
| Portable Programs |                     40 |                      50 |                     20 |
| Archive           |               Variable |         Remaining space |                      - |

Notice the unallocated space is strategically placed. As discussed in [Part 1](https://github.com/pchemguy/Field-Notes/blob/main/02-storage-new-pc/README.md), this space serves as a buffer for partition expansion and as SSD over-provisioning. However, Ventoy has a restriction: its main data partition (YUMI) and the VTOYEFI partition must be adjacent. This restriction means we cannot leave unallocated space directly after the YUMI partition. The workaround is to place the reserve space _after_ the VTOYEFI partition. If you ever need to expand the YUMI partition, use the following workflow:
1. **Delete the EFI Partition:** Use `diskpart` to delete the VTOYEFI partition (WDM will not allow this step).
2. **Extend the Main Partition:** Use WDM or `diskpart` to extend the YUMI partition into the now-adjacent unallocated space.
3. **Recreate the EFI Partition:** Run `Ventoy2Disk` and perform another "Non-destructive Install". Ventoy will automatically recreate the VTOYEFI partition in the correct location.

### 5. Special Case: Adding a Windows To Go Environment

A "Windows To Go" (WTG) installation - a full, bootable Windows environment running from your USB drive - might be useful for emergencies or when you need to work on a guest computer. For multi-boot disks, the WTG environment is typically created as a single bootable virtual hard disk (`.VHDX`) file that you place on the Ventoy partition. While Microsoft has discontinued official support for WTG, several third-party tools can create an equivalent environment from a Windows Installation ISO.:

| Tool                                               | Source Formats             | Destination Flexibility                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Note: this table shows tested and/or officially documented sources/destinations. It does not attempt to include every documented option, so additional options may be available. Check official documentation for more information.

#### Creating the Bootable VHDX

While WinToUSB offers the broadest support for source files, Rufus provides the most flexible destination options, allowing us to install WTG directly onto a virtual disk file without needing an intermediate physical drive. The following workflow details how to create and test your WTG image within a virtual machine before deploying it to the physical USB drive.

1. **Create VHDX:** Use WDM or `diskpart` to create a new `.VHDX` file on your computer.    
2. **Mount VHDX:** Mount the new `.VHDX` file so it appears as a regular drive in Windows.
3. **Install WTG with Rufus:** Run Rufus, select your Windows Installation ISO, and choose the mounted VHDX drive as the destination. Proceed with the Windows To Go installation.
4. **Initial VM Setup:** In VMware or your preferred hypervisor, create a new virtual machine that boots from a physical disk, pointing it to your mounted `.VHDX`-based disk.
5. **Configure Windows:** Boot the new VM. Complete the initial Windows setup (OOBE), install critical drivers, and make any desired software installations or configuration changes within the virtualized WTG environment.
6. **Finalize and Test:**
    - Shut down the VM and unmount the `.VHDX` from your host system.
    - Copy the finalized `.VHDX` file to the main data partition of your Ventoy USB drive (or use YUMI exFAT).
    - Test it by booting a VM and your physical computer from the Ventoy drive and selecting the VHDX file from the boot menu.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> - When booted from a VHDX, Windows may run in a non-persistent mode, meaning changes are not saved back to the `.VHDX` file upon shutdown. For persistent storage, you must save files to one of the other visible partitions on your USB drive, such as your `Archive`  partition.
> - VHD(X) image can also be created from a physical disk using tools like [Sysinternals Disk2vhd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/disk2vhd).
