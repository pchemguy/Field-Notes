# Storage Considerations for a New PC, Part 1: Structuring Internal Storage for Robust Migration and Failure Recovery

The setup of a new computer begins with a choice: accept the pre-installed operating system or start fresh. While using the stock OS can save initial setup time, I have found that the long-term benefits of a clean installation - especially in system manageability - are well worth the upfront effort. A fresh start, however, raises a critical question: how should you structure the storage from day one to simplify future migrations and recovery?

This two-part series documents an approach I have refined for Windows-based workstations. In this **Part 1**, I will focus on the strategy for **internal storage**. This post establishes a set of principles for partitioning a system drive based on a file's role, volatility, and recovery cost. The goal is to create a logical structure that separates the ephemeral (the OS and basic applications) from the essential (your data and customized software environment), which in turn allows for a more efficient and resilient backup strategy.

Implementing this storage architecture, of course, begins with a clean slate. To that end, **[Part 2: Building an External Bootable Drive](https://www.google.com/search?q=link-to-part-2)** details the creation of the necessary tool. It covers how to prepare a versatile drive that allows you to wipe a machine and apply this storage architecture from the ground up.
