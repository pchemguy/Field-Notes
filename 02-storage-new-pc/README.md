# Storage Considerations for a New PC, Part 1: Structuring Internal Storage for Robust Migration and Failure Recovery

The process of setting up a new computer often begins with a choice: either accept the pre-installed operating system or start fresh. Accepting a pre-installed OS, which is available on the majority of pre-assembled computers, may save hours (possibly days) of upfront setup efforts. In my experience, however, investing these efforts by performing a clean setup pays off in improved long-term manageability of the workstation. But a clean installation presents its own challenge: how do you structure the storage from the outset to simplify future migrations and make potential failure recovery less painful?

This two-part series documents an approach I have refined over time for Windows-based personal workstations. This **Part 1** is dedicated to the strategy for **internal storage**. I will establish a set of principles for partitioning the system drive based on a file's role and backup/recovery considerations. The goal is to create a logical structure that separates the ephemeral (the OS) from the essential (user data and optimized software environment). This structure lends itself to optimized hybrid backing strategies facilitating replication of the system and improving its resilience.

This strategy, of course, begins with a clean slate. To that end, **[Part 2: Building an External Bootable Drive](https://www.google.com/search?q=link-to-part-2)** details the creation of the necessary tool. It covers how to prepare a versatile drive that allows you to wipe a machine and apply this storage structure from the ground up.
